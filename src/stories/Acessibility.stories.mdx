# Accessibility Notes

<div className="subheading">Accessibility</div>

Making Design Accessible means a deeply caring about providing a fantastic user experience.

This Includes:

<ul>
  <li>A beautiful and functional Design</li>
  <li>Consistent & Useful Copy</li>
  <li>Principles of Universal Design and Inclusivity</li>
</ul>

<div className="subheading">Usable for Everyone</div>

We value our Customers - Partners - Employees & the Music community. 

It is important to us, that our Products are accessible to these groups of people.
That also means we need to pay special attention to members of these communities
who have disabilities. 

Disabilities impact how the ability of people to;
<ol>
  <li>See</li>
  <li>Move</li>
  <li>Hear</li>
  <li>Learn</li>
  <li>Understand & Process Information</li>
</ol>

Therefore it is very important for us to consider how design and development of our products can support a wide range of experiences.

<div className="subheading">Assistive Technology Support</div>

The components in this design system are tested for accessibility. Employees & Customers should expect to be able to access features built with our components using assistive technologies.

For example:
<ol>
  <li>Screen Readers</li>
  <li>Alternative Keyboards</li>
  <li>Switch Devices</li>
  <li>Tools for Readability</li>
</ol>
